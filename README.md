開課系所: 電機碩  
授課教師: 魏家博 (Chia-Po Wei)  

Every homework is well structed and with well document.  
* HW1  
    a. Simple `Linear Algerba` question  
    b. Least Squares Problem and Optimization  

* HW2  
    a. Image processing  
    1. Drawing bounding box with .pkl  
    2. Cropped image with bounding box information  
    3. Dlib face detection  
    
    b. Show bounding box information by analyzing .txt  

* HW3  
    a. Image filtering with tensorflow `functional-API` and compared with different padding mode with `same` and `valid`.  
    b. Develope CNN with SISO (single input single output) and SIMO (single input multiple output).  

* HW4  
    a. using `tensorflow` API to train the model based on `Fashion MNIST`  
    * Note: it is a very quick guideline that is deserved to read when you are umfamilar with tensorflow.  

    b. Another tensorflow model practice again, but implemented with `pickle` library.
